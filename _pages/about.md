I am Third Year PhD Candidate @<a href='https://www.strath.ac.uk/'>The University of Strathclyde</a> as part of the 
<a href='https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/subjects/computerinformationscience/strathclydeischoolresearchgroup/'>iSchool Research Group</a> and <a href='https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/79762/1/Moshfeghi_DESIRE_2021_NeuraSearch_neuroscience_and_information_retrieval.pdf'>NeuraSearch Laboratory</a>
under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=BaFcnWIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr Yashar Moshfeghi</a>. Before starting my PhD in 2022, I completed a four year undergrad in Computer Science 
at the University of Strathclyde, graduating with a 1st Class Honours and obtaining the Charles Babbage prize for the highest performing dissertation.


My research focuses on the use of contemporary Machine Learning models for the processing and decoding of neurphysiological data, specifically Electroencephalography (EEG) data and its downstream applications 
in domains such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Retrieval (IR). If you wish to get in contact with regarding potential work/collaboration, or simply to talk about
