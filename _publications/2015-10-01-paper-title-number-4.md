excerpt: 'Recent works have demonstrated the potential of Electroencephalography (EEG)
data to develop models for downstream Natural Language Process (NLP) tasks.
However, the shortage of sufficiently large EEG datasets for NLP has created a
training bottleneck, hindering the advancement of research in this area. With con-
tributing factors associated with conducting an EEG-based user study such as cost,
time, the difficulty of obtaining high-quality EEG data, the hardware requirements,
and specialised skill set, as well as the potential of capturing sensitive/personal data,
it is crucial to explore alternative avenues to increase the size of the existing EEG
datasets without the collection of new data samples. To do so, this paper proposes
generating synthetic EEG samples via augmenting pre-existing EEG datasets for
NLP to capture the semantics of textual input. To study our proposed approach,
we develop CREATOR, synthetiC neuRolinguistic EEG dAta generaTOR, which
leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) conditioned on text input to
produce synthetic EEG samples for data augmentation. We investigated the effec-
tiveness of SENSE on three popular EEG-Text paired NLP tasks i.e. Named Entity
Recognition, Sentiment Classification, and EEG-To-Text decoding. Our findings
demonstrate that the synthetic EEG samples generated via CREATOR resulted in a
statistically significant increase in the overall performance of each task by 6.6%,
6.1%, and 7.9% respectively. Furthermore, the findings of our extensive ablation
analysis reveal that the enhancement in performance is attributable to incorporating
CREATOR EEG samples into task datasets. Our proposed CREATOR model serves
as a first step in the production of synthetic EEG data samples for downstream NLP
tasks facilitating the training of large and more complex Neurolinguistic models.'
