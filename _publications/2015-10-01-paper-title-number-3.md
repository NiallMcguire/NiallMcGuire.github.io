Study"

excerpt: 'One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to
satisfy searchers’ Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs
physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process.
However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG)
data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes
associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate
how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As
such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisa-
tion of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a
Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the
combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive perfor-
mance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a
subject’s realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from
this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time
prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an
accuracy of 73.5% (SD 2.6%) and on a per-subject basis with an
accuracy of 90.1% (SD 22.1%). This work helps to close the gap by
bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible
improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way
for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.'
